This is a C++ wrapper for the sleepycat db4 database.

Although sleepycat provide a C++ wrapper I was not happy
with it. This library aims to provide a better interface
by using more C++ features.

These are the main design points:

1) Using STL in the API where sensible. For example, to
   read a range of keys an STL like iterator object should
   be used.
2) Allowing Standard IOStreams for data access where sensible,
   for example getting the value of a key should be able to use 
   an istream interface to allow simple partial value retreival.
3) move transaction parameter to be last optional param 
   or provde two versions of the same method for trans/nontrans
4) Modification of API to use more standard types.
5) Use of operator overloading to allow quick and dirty coding
   mydb[ "key" ] = "value"; to set and 
   cerr << mydb["key"] << endl; to read values

You will of course still require the C db4 library to use this 
wrapper.

Dependancies;
* ferrisloki
* a std::string class that can have its contents written to via
  the pointer returned from string::data(). This could be changed
  but I wanted to preserve the speed of a string::resize() followed
  by getting db4 to load data directly into the string.

Can notice and take advantage of;
stlport

As of version 0.3.1 the tarball includes the db4 library source aswell.
Sleepycat recommend projects do this and the redhat9 db4 rpms have
issues.

You might need to use --with-pic configure option on A64 machines
