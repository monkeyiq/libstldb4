	* 0.3.4 released

(0.3.4)

2003-09-19  monkeyiq  <monkeyiq@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Announcement: Added close() method so that databases can be explicitly
	  closed and exceptions handled before the destructor call. Default null
	  environment doesn't implicitly create a transacted environment as a side
	  effect anymore. Added getWithDefault() to allow getting a value with a 
	  defaulted value on error.
	
	* made the default environment not implicitly actually
	  tell db4 to setup transactions even though it shouldn't

	* added close() method that can throw. dtor calls close()
	  which is impotent if the db is already closed but can
	  throw if the db is open and closing fails.
	
2003-09-06  monkeyiq  <monkeyiq@users.sourceforge.net>

	http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/ref/env/region.html
	Should provide reasonable protection from multiple instances of the
	same app by default but not threading by default.

	* Most open/create methods now also accept file:// URLs
	
2003-08-20  monkeyiq  <monkeyiq@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Added set_pagesize() to Database class

	  that caused the exception to be thrown

2003-08-02  monkeyiq  <monkeyiq@users.sourceforge.net>

	* added DatabaseIterator::moveCursorNextDup()

	Improved configure.in checks for loki and ferrisstreams
	
	Fri May  9, 2003 @  5:36 PM
